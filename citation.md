All the code was authored by me independently.
I discussed with Naomi and Didi at a very high level about approaches to solving certain bugs and tackling the assignment
using the information we got from YEAH hours. This wasn't necessarily how to solve a certain problem but more so about
interpreting the spec or talking about how we might approach solving a bug. This was mostly for assignments printf and onwards. We never
shared any code so I would say this is Type 1.
